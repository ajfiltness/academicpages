Translation of research into policy/practice 
Throughout my career I have worked on a range of short term industry and government funded projects. In total I have authored 25 reports which were directly commissioned to advance knowledge and to inform policy and practice. Eight of these reports were for Australian state governments. Recently, an international review of drug driving policy best practice and taxi driver fatigue management to inform NSW policy amendments. Two reports have been part of Austroads (national) projects. Such reports assist Austroads in providing technical input into national transport policy development. Outcomes from a recent research study conducted for the Australasian Centre for Rail Innovation has resulted in updates to AS1742 Part 7 Standard required sighting distance at passive level crossings. I have authored three reports for the Police Association of NSW regarding officer safety and comfort in police vehicles. The Police Association works closely with the Police Force to improve workplace health and safety; this work program influenced NSW police officers being allowed to carry their firearm in a thigh holster rather than on a waist belt. In addition, my PhD research was of direct interest to OSA patients and I was invited to speak at a local NHS patient association group to encourage patients not to drive when they are sleepy. Recently, I have been worked with the Australian Ballooning Federation to improve safety in ballooning operations through incident report analysis. Outcomes of this project were picked up by the Ballooning Federation of American and the British Balloon and Airship Club who also disseminated findings to their members. 


Reviewing  
Regularly undertake peer reviews for Applied Ergonomics, Accident Analysis and Prevention, and also Traffic Injury Prevention in the road safety domain. Additionally, technology journals on the topic of fatigue detection (IET Intelligent Transport Systems, Journal of Psychosomatic Research). Within the sleep research domain Journal of Sleep Research, Biological Psychology and Injury. Provided peer review services for the Australasian Road Safety Research, Policing and Education Conference and the Australian College of Road Safety Conference.
