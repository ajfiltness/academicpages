Caffeine is a commonly used countermeasure to driver sleepiness. Previous research with truck drivers has demonstrated a positive impact of caffeine consumption on crash risk. However, habitual use of caffeine has the potential to impair night time sleep resulting in increased sleepiness and safety risk. One group that may be particularly vulnerable to the potential negative impacts of high caffeine consumption are those truck drivers who consume ≥ 5 caffeinated drinks per day (≥90th percentile American average daily caffeine consumption).\n\n#### Method:\n1,653 self-reported low (1 caffeinated drink per day) and 1,354 high (≥5 caffeinated drinks per day) caffeine consumers were compared across a range of driving safety indicators, health and sleep variables. All drivers completed an initial background questionnaire including the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), Berlin Questionnaire (BQ) and Dula Dangerous Driving Index (DDDI). Crashes and driving violations were monitored for up to 3 years (depending on enrolment date). Medical Examination Reports were available for 83.0% of the 3,007 participants.\n\n#### Results:\nHigh caffeine consumers were more likely to report poor sleep outcomes: shorter average sleep time, (7.08 h compared to 7.41 h), higher prevalence of excessive daytime sleepiness (7.5% compared to 5.7%) and higher proportion at high risk of obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) on the BQ (13.1% compared with 9.4%). The higher caffeine consumers were more likely to report negative health behaviours: smoking, alcohol consumption, poor diet and infrequent exercise. Poorer driving safety indicators (negative emotions and aggressive driving on the DDDI) and previous crashes (27.8% compared to 21.6%) were also more common in high than low caffeine consumers.\n#### Conclusion:\nCaffeine is an effective countermeasure to driver sleepiness, however, high caffeine consumers do not exhibit any benefit to driving safety indicators. In fact, there is some evidence for safety concern because high caffeine consumers self-report more crashes and worse driving safety indicators than low caffeine consumers. High caffeine consumption was associated with poor health behaviours. Further research is needed to fully understand the implications of high caffeine use. Interventions aiming to reduce truck driver sleepiness should be cautious in promotion of caffeine in isolation; a wholistic approach to improve driver health would likely be more effective than focusing on sleep health alone.","tags":null,"title":"Associations between high caffeine consumption, driving safety indicators, sleep and health behaviours in truck drivers","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Fran Pilkington-Cheney","Ashleigh Filtness","Wendy Jones","Sally Maynard","Alistair Gibb","Roger Haslam"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"7d226cfcdf7db8b73b481f5ab459f289","permalink":"/publication/pilkington-2020-biomathematical/","publishdate":"2020-06-23T21:21:42.354054Z","relpermalink":"/publication/pilkington-2020-biomathematical/","section":"publication","summary":"Worker fatigue is an important risk factor in civil engineering and construction projects, particularly when night-time shift working is required.

Two studies examined whether discrete areas of attention are equally affected by sleep loss. This was achieved using a repeated-measures within-subjects design, with two contrasting conditions: normal sleep and partial sleep restriction of 5-h. Study 1 compared performance on a sustained attention task (Psychomotor Vigilance task; PVT) with performance on a transient attention task (Attentional Blink; AB). PVT performance, but not performance on the AB task, was impaired after sleep restriction. Study 2 sought to determine the neural underpinnings of the phenomenon, using electroencephalogram (EEG) frequency analysis, which measured activity during the brief eyes-closed resting state before the tasks. AB performance was unaffected by sleep restriction, despite clearly observable changes in brain activity. EEG results showed a significant reduction in resting state alpha oscillations that was most prominent centrally in the right hemisphere. Changes in individual alpha and delta power were also found to be related to changes in subjective sleepiness and PVT performance. Results likely reflect different levels of impairment in specific forms of attention following sleep loss.","tags":null,"title":"The impact of sleep loss on sustained and transient attention: an EEG study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ashleigh Filtness"],"categories":["media"],"content":"","date":1575985902,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1575985902,"objectID":"5de1b89b8d5b605d1944e953f8def4e7","permalink":"/publication/roadsafe/","publishdate":"2019-12-10T14:51:42+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/roadsafe/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["media"],"title":"Loughborough’s lifesaving road safety research given royal recognition at The Savoy","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ashleigh Filtness"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1567415052,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1567415052,"objectID":"a98df2eeece12588f147b639d534b650","permalink":"/talk/att/","publishdate":"2020-07-16T23:11:35+01:00","relpermalink":"/talk/att/","section":"talk","summary":"You’ve worked a 12-hour shift, been up all night with a new baby, and driven back to work to start it all again, grabbing an energy drink before you go on shift. That’s normal, that’s ok, everyone does it, life carries on…\nYou’ve worked a 12-hour shift, slept fine for 8 hours, driven to work, stopped off for a pint before going back on shift. That’s not ok, that’s the way to endanger others and lose your job, with life-changing consequences…\nResearch suggests that 24 hours without sleep is the equivalent of being 25% over the UK drink-driving limit* and yet we don’t recognize how dangerous it is. Why don’t we treat tired driving like drunk driving? A review of international evidence indicates that driver fatigue may be a contributory factor in up to a fifth of road accidents, and up to one quarter of fatal and serious accidents. When you look at the number of deaths of people traveling to and from shift work, the figures should upset us. While data for some sectors is hard to come by, we know that in the decade up to 2018, 30 UK police officers were killed on the roads travelling to or from work, many in the early hours of the morning.\nAnd yet we still find it difficult to admit to being tired. In this podcast, Adam Christopher goes underground with the Bank Capacity Upgrade Project night shift to find out how shift patterns impact workers. He hears about the devastating effect on John Owens – arrested for dangerous driving after a shift. He also talks to specialist academics and practitioners Dr Ashleigh Filtness, Lecturer in Transport Safety at Loughborough Design School; Judith Devlin, HSE Advisor at Morgan Sindall Infrastructure; and Yvonne Taylor, Police Inspector and PhD research student about technological advances in fatigue management, and their retrospective approaches, observations and suggestions.\n*24 hours without sleep equivalent 100mg/100ml of blood where the UK drink-driving limit is 80mg/100ml of blood.

Consequently, situation awareness in critical situations is reduced and safe driving performance following emergency takeovers is impeded. A driving simulator study was used to assess the impact of dynamically communicating system uncertainties on monitoring, trust, workload, takeovers, and physiological responses. The uncertainty information was conveyed visually using a stylised heart beat combined with a numerical display and users were engaged in a visual search task. Multilevel analysis results suggest that uncertainty communication helps operators calibrate their trust and gain situation awareness prior to critical situations, resulting in safer takeovers. In addition, eye tracking data indicate that operators can adjust their gaze behaviour in correspondence with the level of uncertainty. However, conveying uncertainties using a visual display significantly increases operator workload and impedes users in the execution of non-driving related tasks.\n#### Practitioner Summary:\nThis article illustrates how the communication of system uncertainty information helps operators calibrate their trust in automation and, consequently, gain situation awareness.

This article presents the findings from a study which collected and analysed data on the factors that lead to drivers engaging in each behaviour. The study involved a survey of drivers' perceptions of the causes of each behaviour and a subject matter expert workshop to gain the views of road safety experts. The results were mapped onto a systems ergonomics model of the road transport system in Queensland, Australia, to show where in the system the factors reside. In addition to well-known factors relating to drivers' knowledge, experience and personality, additional factors at the higher levels of the road transport system related to road safety policy, transport system design, road rules and regulations, and societal issues were identified. It is concluded that the fatal five behaviours have a web of interacting contributory factors underpinning them and are systems problems rather than driver-centric problems.

A descriptive analysis with hospital data from Spain and the Netherlands was carried out to examine the effect of certain choices concerning in- and exclusion criteria based on codes of the ICD9-CM and ICD10. The main parameters explored were: deaths before and after 30 days, readmissions, and external injury causes. Additionally, an analysis was done to explore the impact of using different conversion tools to derive MAIS3 + using data from Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Netherlands, and Spain.

This analysis was carried out within the SafetyCube project, which aimed to identify and quantify the effects of risk factors and measures related to behaviour, infrastructure or vehicles, and integrate the results in an innovative road safety Decision Support System (DSS). The evaluation was conducted by examining studies from the existing literature. These were selected and analysed using a specifically designed common methodology. Infrastructure risk factors were structured in a hierarchical taxonomy of 10 areas with several risk factors in each area (59 specific risk factors in total), examples include: alignment features (e.g. horizontal-vertical alignment deficiencies), cross-section characteristics (e.g. superelevation, lanes, median and shoulder deficiencies), road surface deficiencies, workzones, junction deficiencies (interchange and at-grade) etc. Consultation with infrastructure stakeholders (international organisations, road authorities, etc.) took place in dedicated workshops to identify user needs for the DSS, as well as “hot topics” of particular importance. The following analysis methodology was applied to each infrastructure risk factor: (i) A search for relevant international literature, (ii) Selection of studies on the basis of rigorous criteria, (iii) Analysis of studies in terms of design, methods and limitations, (iv) Synthesis of findings - and meta-analysis, when feasible.

If it is contingent then it becomes predictable. If it is predictable it becomes potentially usable for innovating new ways to improve the safety and utility of this important transport mode. Eighteen motorcyclists took part in a 15 km on-road study during which they were videoed, tracked via GPS, and followed by a ‘chase vehicle’ as they negotiated intersections, all the while providing a concurrent verbal commentary. The verbal commentary was content analysed using a novel method for mapping the verbalized emotional themes to the Circumplex Model. Network analysis was then used to explore the state changes between affective zones in the model. Riders’ emotions at intersections were found to vacillate between negative and positive affect, demonstrating high degrees of emotional dynamism. Many of these transitions occur in and out of the dominant positive state of calmness, with non-calm states appearing to be aversive and those which riders were seeking to avoid. Knowing this brings forward interesting new approaches for safe intersection design.","tags":null,"title":"Riding the emotional roller-coaster: Using the circumplex model of affect to model motorcycle riders’ emotional state-changes at intersections","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lyndel J Bates","Grégoire S Larue","Ashleigh J Filtness","Alana Hawkins"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"f96ce9f2d6b0d0ac33f0b99f303b734d","permalink":"/publication/bates-2019-simulators/","publishdate":"2020-06-23T21:21:42.352308Z","relpermalink":"/publication/bates-2019-simulators/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper examines simulators to deliver driver education programs for two very different populations (a) those who have specific impairments or intellectual disabilities and (b) those who may suffer disadvantage associated with their ethnicity. To do this we addressed two research questions (a) What role, if any, can simulation play as an education and/or training intervention for individuals disadvantaged because of individually-orientated concerns such as intellectual impairment or ADHD? (b) What role, if any, can simulation play as an education and/or training intervention for those who are disadvantaged because of their indigenous ethnicity? Technological developments have enabled the incorporation of driving simulators into driver education programs. A review of major databases using keywords identified 2,420 records. After duplicates were removed and screening occurred, thirteen studies were included in the review. The disadvantaged populations for the driver education initiatives that incorporated a simulator were very specific (e.g. intellectual disabilities) with no interventions for those disadvantaged because of ethnicity. A second search identified six papers that discussed interventions for indigenous populations. None of these interventions had a simulator component. The review highlights the need for high quality empirical research in the area of simulators, driver education and disadvantaged groups in order to inform policy development within this area.

Increased sleepiness has been shown to impair reaction time, vigilance, and cognitive decision making, skills which are vital to safety critical tasks such as driving. Sleep related crashes have been shown to be prevalent in shift workers due to a combination of work and home related factors, impacting sleep and resulting in increased sleepiness. Night workers especially are required to be alert and perform duties during times of decreased alertness, often then commuting home, increasing their risk of a sleep related crash. It is important that responsibility for sleep related crashes and workplace incidents is shared between the employer and employee. While individuals have a responsibility to ensure they are rested for work and adequately alert to drive, if shift schedules and patterns result in extended work periods and reduced opportunities to rest, individuals may experience excessive workplace or driver sleepiness despite their best attempts to manage their rest. Establishing an open culture environment within the workplace to encourage discussions relating to sleepiness as well as providing education relating to causes and consequences of sleepiness is an important initiative.

However, it is possible that identifying how psychosocial factors affect perceptions of driver education may contribute to improve program design, content and implementation. The Goals for Driver Education (GDE) framework was used in this research to explore the impact of various psychosocial factors, such as sensation seeking, normlessness, attitudes towards driver risk taking and positive attitudes towards speeding on the perceptions of young drivers participating in a professional driver education courses. One hundred and fourteen young drivers (Mage = 17.89, SD = 0.85) who had attended a driver education course within the past three years completed an online survey that collected socio-demographic information, perceptions of the benefits of education for individuals learning to drive at each level of the GDE framework, and information about psychosocial factors. Overall, the results suggested that psychosocial factors do affect young driver perceptions of driver education and training. Higher levels of sensation seeking predicted that participants thought it beneficial for novice driver education to focus on vehicle manoeuvring (Level 1), mastery of traffic situations (Level 2) and goals and contexts for driving (Level 3) but not the highest level of the GDE matrix, goals for life. Higher levels of normlessness predicted participants believing it was more beneficial for new drivers to learn about the goals and contexts for driving. This suggests there is a need for driver educators to consider personalising their programs as much as possible to take into account the psychosocial differences between individuals, which may impact on the way they respond to the education they receive.","tags":null,"title":"The effect of psychosocial factors on perceptions of driver education using the goals for driver education framework","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Heike Martensen","Kevin Diependaele","Stijn Daniels","Wouter Van den Berghe","Eleonora Papadimitriou","George Yannis","Ingrid Van Schagen","Wendy Weijermars","Wim Wijnen","Ashleigh Filtness"," others"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"40724a49f0af54959f082d8307db5735","permalink":"/publication/martensen-2019-european/","publishdate":"2020-06-23T21:21:42.351394Z","relpermalink":"/publication/martensen-2019-european/","section":"publication","summary":"The European Road Safety Decision Support System (roadsafety-dss.eu) is an innovative system providing the available evidence on a broad range of road risks and possible countermeasures.

Driver education and training programs have been criticised as being unsystematically designed and lacking an empirical or theoretical basis.

The GDE defines four hierarchical levels of driving behaviours and influences on driving and three individualised Person-specific factors that should be considered in driver education and training programs. The aim of this study was to compare and contrast, in a methodologically rigorous manner, the perceptions that young drivers (n = 22; Mage = 17.80 years, SD = 6.54 months) and driver educators (n = 10; Mage = 54.5 years, SD = 9.21 years) have of a professional driver education and training course they participated in or facilitated. Eight semi-structured focus groups were conducted and the GDE was used to direct the collection and analysis of the data. Young drivers mainly discussed basic driving skills located on the lower levels of the GDE rather than higher level abstract factors that increase risk for young drivers. Driver educators tended to group particular GDE levels and Person-specific factors together when discussing the driving course and paid limited attention to Goals and contexts of driving. Results suggest that driver educators should provide direct instruction regarding the more abstract social and contextual factors that influence driving to potentially increase the efficacy of driver education and training as a safety countermeasure.","tags":null,"title":"A mixed-methods study of driver education informed by the Goals for Driver Education: Do young drivers and educators agree on what was taught?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Wendy Weijermars","Niels Bos","Ashleigh Filtness","Laurie Brown","Robert Bauer","Emmanuelle Dupont","Jean Louis Martin","Katherine Perez","Pete Thomas"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"4c106dfdf92929d7537c1e84310bc3be","permalink":"/publication/weijermars-2018-burden/","publishdate":"2020-06-23T21:21:42.345845Z","relpermalink":"/publication/weijermars-2018-burden/","section":"publication","summary":"#### Background\nInformation about the burden of (non-fatal) road traffic injury is very useful to further improve road safety policy. Previous studies calculated the burden of injury in individual countries. This paper estimates and compares the burden of non-fatal serious road traffic injuries in six EU countries/regions: Austria, Belgium, England, The Netherlands, the Rhône region in France and Spain.\n#### Methods\nIt is a cross-sectional study based on hospital discharge databases.\n#### Population\nof study are patients hospitalized with MAIS3+ due to road traffic injuries. The burden of injury (expressed in years lived with disability (YLD)) is calculated applying a method that is developed within the INTEGRIS study. The method assigns estimated disability information to the casualties using the EUROCOST injury classification.\n#### Results\nThe average burden per MAIS3+ casualty varies between 2.4 YLD and 3.2 YLD per casualty. About 90% of the total burden of injury of MAIS3+ casualties is due to lifelong consequences that are experienced by 19% to 33% of the MAIS3+ casualties. Head injuries, spinal cord injuries and injuries to the lower extremities are responsible for more than 90% of the total burden of MAIS3+ road traffic injuries. Results per transport mode differ between the countries. Differences between countries are mainly due to differences in age distribution and in the distribution over EUROCOST injury groups of the casualties.\n#### Conclusion\nThe analyses presented in this paper can support further improvement of road safety policy. Countermeasures could for example be focused at reducing skull and brain injuries, spinal cord injuries and injuries to the lower extremities, as these injuries are responsible for more than 90% of the total burden of injury of MAIS3+ casualties.","tags":null,"title":"Burden of injury of serious road injuries in six EU countries","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Grégoire S Larue","Ashleigh J Filtness","Joanne M Wood","Sebastien Demmel","Christopher N Watling","Anjum Naweed","Andry Rakotonirainy"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"f33601f735a3c85b7bf3db328b68e9f5","permalink":"/publication/larue-2018-safe/","publishdate":"2020-06-23T21:21:42.345337Z","relpermalink":"/publication/larue-2018-safe/","section":"publication","summary":"Improving the safety at passive rail crossings is an ongoing issue worldwide. These crossings have no active warning systems to assist drivers’ decision-making and are completely reliant on the road user perceiving the approach of a train to decide whether to enter a crossing or not. This study aimed to better understand drivers’ judgements regarding approaching trains and their perceptions of safe crossing. Thirty-six participants completed a field-based protocol that involved detecting and judging the speeds of fast moving trains. They were asked to report when they first detected an approaching train, when they could first perceive it as moving, as well as providing speed estimates and a decision regarding when it would not be safe to cross. Participants detected the trains ∼2 km away and were able to perceive the trains as moving when they were 1.6 km away. Large differences were observed between participants but all could detect trains within the range of the longest sighting distances required at passive level crossings. Most participants greatly underestimated travelling speed by at least 30%, despite reporting high levels of confidence in their estimates. Further, most participants would have entered the crossing at a time when the lights would have been activated if the level crossing had been protected by flashing lights. These results suggest that the underestimation of high-speed trains could have significant safety implications for road users’ crossing behaviour, particularly as it reduces the amount of time and the safety margins that the driver has to cross the rail crossing.","tags":null,"title":"Is it safe to cross?

Moreover, the effect of differences in practices on the estimated number of MAIS3+ casualties was investigated by applying different methods to the same data. Finally, by means of a literature review, analysis of additional case studies, and burden of injury calculations, health impacts of serious road injuries were investigated. This paper presents six main lessons learned from these activities. Practices concerning the estimation of the number of MAIS3+ casualties differ between countries; some countries apply correction factors to police data, other countries use hospital data, and a third group of countries uses linked police and hospital data. Practices also differ concerning the selection of MAIS3+ road traffic injuries within hospital data. Differences in methodology appear to affect the MAIS3+ estimate. Therefore, one should be careful when comparing figures from different countries. The SafetyCube guidelines can support further harmonization. It is important to reduce the number of serious road injuries because injuries can have major impacts on a casualty’s life and pose a burden to society. About 75% of the MAIS3+ road traffic casualties are not fully recovered 3 years postcrash.

Sleep-related crashes occur on both urban and rural roads, yet to date driver-sleepiness research has focused on understanding impairment in rural and motorway driving. The ability to detect changes is an attention and awareness skill vital for everyday safe driving. Previous research has demonstrated that person states, such as age or motivation, influence susceptibility to change blindness (i.e., failure or delay in detecting changes). The current work considers whether sleepiness increases the likelihood of change blindness within urban and rural driving contexts. Twenty fully-licenced drivers completed a change detection ‘flicker’ task twice in a counterbalanced design: once following a normal night of sleep (7–8 h) and once following sleep restriction (5 h). Change detection accuracy and response time were recorded while eye movements were continuously tracked. Accuracy was not significantly affected by sleep loss; however, following sleep loss there was some evidence of slowed change detection responses to urban images, but faster responses for rural images. Visual scanning across the images remained consistent between sleep conditions, resulting in no difference in the probability of fixating on the change target. Overall, the results suggest that sleep loss has minimal impact on change detection accuracy and visual scanning for changes in driving scenes. However, a subtle difference in response time to change detection between urban and rural images indicates that change blindness may have implications for sleep-related crashes in more visually complex urban environments. Further research is needed to confirm this finding.","tags":null,"title":"Sleep loss and change detection in driving scenes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ashleigh Filtness"],"categories":["project"],"content":"Over a series of investigations I have worked with police recorded crash data, and self-report experience of those who have had a sleep-related crash to identify common characteristics of sleep crashes.

Drivers experienced negative consequences of fatigue, despite existing countermeasures to mitigate it. Organisational culture was a barrier to effective fatigue management. A fatigue assessment tool consistently informed rostering, however, shift swapping was commonplace and often unregulated, reducing any potential positive impact. In discussing fatigue countermeasure strategies, drivers talked interchangeably about mitigating task related fatigue (e.g. increasing cognitive load) and sleepiness (e.g. caffeine). Ensuring the concepts of fatigue and sleepiness are properly understood has the potential to maximise safety.","tags":null,"title":"Causes, consequences and countermeasures to driver fatigue in the rail industry: The train driver perspective","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Vanessa Beanland","Ashleigh J Filtness","Rhiannon Jeans"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"d7b189df9ad933dbb962df5c442df288","permalink":"/publication/beanland-2017-change/","publishdate":"2020-06-23T21:21:42.338913Z","relpermalink":"/publication/beanland-2017-change/","section":"publication","summary":"The ability to detect changes is crucial for safe driving. Previous research has demonstrated that drivers often experience change blindness, which refers to failed or delayed change detection. The current study explored how susceptibility to change blindness varies as a function of the driving environment, type of object changed, and safety relevance of the change. Twenty-six fully-licenced drivers completed a driving-related change detection task. Changes occurred to seven target objects (road signs, cars, motorcycles, traffic lights, pedestrians, animals, or roadside trees) across two environments (urban or rural). The contextual safety relevance of the change was systematically manipulated within each object category, ranging from high safety relevance (i.e., requiring a response by the driver) to low safety relevance (i.e., requiring no response). When viewing rural scenes, compared with urban scenes, participants were significantly faster and more accurate at detecting changes, and were less susceptible to 'looked-but-failed-to-see' errors. Interestingly, safety relevance of the change differentially affected performance in urban and rural environments. In urban scenes, participants were more efficient at detecting changes with higher safety relevance, whereas in rural scenes the effect of safety relevance has marginal to no effect on change detection. Finally, even after accounting for safety relevance, change blindness varied significantly between target types. Overall the results suggest that drivers are less susceptible to change blindness for objects that are likely to change or move (e.g., traffic lights vs. road signs), and for moving objects that pose greater danger (e.g., wild animals vs. pedestrians).","tags":null,"title":"Change detection in urban and rural driving scenes: Effects of target type and safety relevance on change blindness","type":"publication"},{"authors":["AN Hawkins","Ashleigh J Filtness"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"d6e131dcc9cf9ef153c67e49579dd039","permalink":"/publication/hawkins-2017-driver/","publishdate":"2020-06-23T21:21:42.340146Z","relpermalink":"/publication/hawkins-2017-driver/","section":"publication","summary":"Driver sleepiness is a major contributor to severe crashes and fatalities on our roads. Many people continue to drive despite being aware of feeling tired. Prevention relies heavily on education campaigns as it is difficult to police driver sleepiness. The video sharing social media site YouTube is extremely popular, particularly with at risk driver demographics. Content and popularity of uploaded videos can provide insight into the quality of publicly accessible driver sleepiness information. The purpose of this research was to answer two questions; firstly, how prevalent are driver sleepiness videos on YouTube? And secondly, what are the general characteristics of driver sleepiness videos in terms of (a) outlook on driver sleepiness, (b) tone, (c) countermeasures to driver sleepiness, and, (d) driver demographics.\nUsing a keywords search, 442 relevant videos were found from a five year period (2nd December 2009–2nd December 2014). Tone, outlook, and countermeasure use were thematically coded. Driver demographic and video popularity data also were recorded. The majority of videos portrayed driver sleepiness as dangerous. However, videos that had an outlook towards driver sleepiness being amusing were viewed more often and had more mean per video comments and likes. Humorous videos regardless of outlook, were most popular. Most information regarding countermeasures to deal with driver sleepiness was accurate. Worryingly, 39.8% of videos with countermeasure information contained some kind of ineffective countermeasure. The use of humour to convey messages about the dangers of driver sleepiness may be a useful approach in educational interventions.","tags":null,"title":"Driver sleepiness on YouTube: A content analysis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jolene A Cox","Vanessa Beanland","Ashleigh J Filtness"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"c9d3ab99324ae6c163b7c1f6e4a96bc8","permalink":"/publication/cox-2017-risk/","publishdate":"2020-06-23T21:21:42.346805Z","relpermalink":"/publication/cox-2017-risk/","section":"publication","summary":"#### Objective:\nThe ability to detect changing visual information is a vital component of safe driving. In addition to detecting changing visual information, drivers must also interpret its relevance to safety. Environmental changes considered to have high safety relevance will likely demand greater attention and more timely responses than those considered to have lower safety relevance. The aim of this study was to explore factors that are likely to influence perceptions of risk and safety regarding changing visual information in the driving environment. Factors explored were the environment in which the change occurs (i.e., urban vs. rural), the type of object that changes, and the driver's age, experience, and risk sensitivity.\n#### Methods:\nSixty-three licensed drivers aged 18–70 years completed a hazard rating task, which required them to rate the perceived hazardousness of changing specific elements within urban and rural driving environments. Three attributes of potential hazards were systematically manipulated: the environment (urban, rural); the type of object changed (road sign, car, motorcycle, pedestrian, traffic light, animal, tree); and its inherent safety risk (low risk, high risk). Inherent safety risk was manipulated by either varying the object's placement, on/near or away from the road, or altering an infrastructure element that would require a change to driver behavior. Participants also completed two driving-related risk perception tasks, rating their relative crash risk and perceived risk of aberrant driving behaviors.\n#### Results:\nDriver age was not significantly associated with hazard ratings, but individual differences in perceived risk of aberrant driving behaviors predicted hazard ratings, suggesting that general driving-related risk sensitivity plays a strong role in safety perception. In both urban and rural scenes, there were significant associations between hazard ratings and inherent safety risk, with low-risk changes perceived as consistently less hazardous than high-risk impact changes; however, the effect was larger for urban environments. There were also effects of object type, with certain objects rated as consistently more safety relevant. In urban scenes, changes involving pedestrians were rated significantly more hazardous than all other objects, and in rural scenes, changes involving animals were rated as significantly more hazardous. Notably, hazard ratings were found to be higher in urban compared with rural driving environments, even when changes were matched between environments.\n#### Conclusion:\nThis study demonstrates that drivers perceive rural roads as less risky than urban roads, even when similar scenarios occur in both environments. Age did not affect hazard ratings. Instead, the findings suggest that the assessment of risk posed by hazards is influenced more by individual differences in risk sensitivity. This highlights the need for driver education to account for appraisal of hazards’ risk and relevance, in addition to hazard detection, when considering factors that promote road safety.","tags":null,"title":"Risk and safety perception on urban and rural roads: Effects of environmental features, driver age and risk sensitivity","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ashleigh J Filtness","G Larue","Amy Schramm","Jacqueline Fuller","Andry Rakotonirainy","Clarissa Han","Peter Cairney"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"fc055a3a284a73f7b95be15563370c62","permalink":"/publication/filtness-2017-safety/","publishdate":"2020-06-23T21:21:42.347724Z","relpermalink":"/publication/filtness-2017-safety/","section":"publication","summary":"#### Background\nAs road complexity increases the requirement for number of road signs also increases, although the amount of road side space does not. One practical strategy to address this is to present multiple road signs on the same gantry (sign co-location).

Each scenario presented similar information using direction signs, variable message signs and variable speed limit signs, under. Each drive included standard motorway driving (100 km/h speed zone) in free flow traffic and one emergency event where a lead vehicle suddenly braked. The scenario order was counterbalanced and the emergency event vehicle varied.\n#### Results\nOverall, there was no impact of co-locating signs on general driving performance. No significant difference was observed between conditions for reaction time and minimum headway in response to the emergency event. Participants were able to correctly choose their destination whether the signs were co-located or not.\n#### Discussion\nFor the particular configuration of signs tested there is no evidence that co-location negatively impacts driving performance. However, there may be some implications for travel speed and the manner in which the emergency event is responded to. Future work should confirm the findings on real roads. These findings provided support for sign co-location as a practical and safe option for displaying multiple road signs in a confined area.","tags":null,"title":"Safety implications of co-locating road signs: A driving simulator investigation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ashleigh J Filtness","Kerry A Armstrong","Angela Watson","Simon S Smith"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"eca6c1fb079b55f01fdcacf38435d855","permalink":"/publication/filtness-2017-related/","publishdate":"2020-06-23T21:21:42.339727Z","relpermalink":"/publication/filtness-2017-related/","section":"publication","summary":"Sleep-related (SR) crashes are an endemic problem the world over. However, police officers report difficulties in identifying sleepiness as a crash contributing factor. One approach to improving the sensitivity of SR crash identification is by applying a proxy definition post hoc to crash reports. To identify the prominent characteristics of SR crashes and highlight the influence of proxy definitions, ten years of Queensland (Australia) police reports of crashes occurring in ≥100 km/h speed zones were analysed. In Queensland, two approaches are routinely taken to identifying SR crashes. First, attending police officers identify crash causal factors; one possible option is ‘fatigue/fell asleep’. Second, a proxy definition is applied to all crash reports. Those meeting the definition are considered SR and added to the police-reported SR crashes. Of the 65,204 vehicle operators involved in crashes 3449 were police-reported as SR. Analyses of these data found that male drivers aged 16–24 years within the first two years of unsupervised driving were most likely to have a SR crash. Collision with a stationary object was more likely in SR than in not-SR crashes. Using the proxy definition 9739 (14.9%) crashes were classified as SR. Using the proxy definition removes the findings that SR crashes are more likely to involve males and be of high severity. Additionally, proxy defined SR crashes are no less likely at intersections than not-SR crashes. When interpreting crash data it is important to understand the implications of SR identification because strategies aimed at reducing the road toll are informed by such data. Without the correct interpretation, funding could be misdirected. Improving sleepiness identification should be a priority in terms of both improvement to police and proxy reporting.","tags":null,"title":"Sleep-related crash characteristics: Implications for applying a fatigue definition to crash reports","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ashleigh J Filtness","Kerry Ann Armstrong","Angela Watson","Simon S Smith"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"d6b3fce362b2ac284ff2d0b2a0fc4aaa","permalink":"/publication/filtness-2017-sleep/","publishdate":"2020-06-23T21:21:42.339313Z","relpermalink":"/publication/filtness-2017-sleep/","section":"publication","summary":"#### Background\nVery little is known about the characteristics of sleep related (SR) crashes occurring on low speed roads compared with current understanding of the role of sleep in crashes occurring on high speed roads e.g. motorways. To address this gap, analyses were undertaken to identify the differences and similarities between (1) SR crashes occurring on roads with low (≤60 km/h) and high (≥100 km/h) speed limits, and (2) SR crashes and not-SR crashes occurring on roads with low speed limits.\n#### Method\nPolice reports of all crashes occurring on low and high speed roads over a ten year period between 2000 and 2009 were examined for Queensland, Australia. Attending police officers identified all crash attributes, including ‘fatigue/fell asleep’, which indicates that the police believe the crash to have a causal factor relating to falling asleep, sleepiness due to sleep loss, time of day, or fatigue. Driver or rider involvement in crashes was classified as SR or not-SR. All crash-associated variables were compared using Chi-square tests (Cramer’s V = effect size). A series of logistic regression was performed, with driver and crash characteristics as predictors of crash category. A conservative alpha level of 0.001 determined statistical significance.\n#### Results\nThere were 440,855 drivers or riders involved in a crash during this time; 6923 (1.6%) were attributed as SR. SR crashes on low speed roads have similar characteristics to those on high speed roads with young (16–24y) males consistently over represented. SR crashes on low speed roads are noticeably different to not-SR crashes in the same speed zone in that male and young novice drivers are over represented and outcomes are more severe. Of all the SR crashes identified, 41% occurred on low speed roads.\n#### Conclusion\nSR crashes are not confined to high speed roads. Low speed SR crashes warrant specific investigation because they occur in densely populated areas, exposing a greater number of people to risk and have more severe outcomes than not-SR crashes on the same low speed roads.","tags":null,"title":"Sleep-related vehicle crashes on low speed roads","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Angela Watson","James Freeman","Kelly Imberger","Ashleigh J Filtness","Hollie Wilson","David Healy","Antonietta Cavallo"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"f2337aaff688079a2a24a12c87e8e8c1","permalink":"/publication/watson-2017-effects/","publishdate":"2020-06-23T21:21:42.34731Z","relpermalink":"/publication/watson-2017-effects/","section":"publication","summary":"Drink-driving remains a major road safety concern that creates a significant social burden. Licence disqualification continues to play a key role in drink driving deterrence and sanctions together with police enforcement to address the problem in most motorised countries. However, on-going questions remain regarding the differing effect of licence disqualification periods between first time and repeat offenders, and between other sub-groups of offenders. As a result, this study aimed to determine whether: (a) differences exist in re-offence rates of convicted drink-drivers between: the period between committing the drink-driving offence and licence disqualification (pre-licence disqualification), during the period of licence disqualification, and after being re-licensed (post-licence restoration); and (b) differential effects of offence rates are evident based on Blood Alcohol Content (BAC), gender, age, repeat offender status and crash involvement at the time of offence. The sample consisted of 29,204 drink-driving offenders detected in Victoria, Australia between 1 January 1996 and 30 September 2002. The analysis indicated that licence disqualifications were effective as drink-driving offenders had a significantly lower rate of offending (both drink-driving and other traffic offences) during licence disqualifications compared to pre-licence disqualification and post-licence restoration periods. The influence of licence disqualification appeared to extend beyond the disqualification period, as offence rates were lower during post-licence restoration than during pre-licence disqualification. Interestingly, the highest rate of offending (both for drink-driving and other traffic offences) was during the pre-licence disqualification period, which suggests offenders are particularly vulnerable to drink and drive while waiting to be sanctioned. A consistent pattern of results was evident across genders and age groups. Additionally, those who were involved in a crash at the same time as their index offence had lower offence rates (compared to those who were not involved in a crash) for all periods, although for general traffic offences, the offence rate was highest in the post-licence restoration period for those who had a crash at index offence. This indicates that being involved in a crash may deter these offenders, at least in the short-term. The implications of the results for managing both first time and repeat offenders are discussed.","tags":null,"title":"The effects of licence disqualification on drink-drivers: Is it the same for everyone?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Vanessa Beanland","Paul M Salmon","Ashleigh J Filtness","Michael G Lenné","Neville A Stanton"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"db30738f1175c79a4ade9a01b827164d","permalink":"/publication/beanland-2017-stop/","publishdate":"2020-06-23T21:21:42.34632Z","relpermalink":"/publication/beanland-2017-stop/","section":"publication","summary":"Many rail level crossings (RLXs) have only passive protection, such as static signs instructing road users to stop, yield, or look for trains. Stop signs have been suggested as a low-cost option to improve safety at passive RLXs, as requiring drivers to stop should encourage safe behaviour. However, field observations have noted high rates of non-compliance at stop-controlled RLXs. To explore this further, we conducted an on-road study to identify factors that influence compliance at stop-controlled RLXs. Twenty-two drivers drove a 30.5km route in rural Australia, encompassing three stop-controlled RLXs. In over half of all cases (59%) drivers stopped completely at the RLX; on 27% of crossings drivers executed a rolling stop, and on 14% of crossings drivers violated the stop controls. Rolling stops were defined as a continuous deceleration to 10km/h. Behavioural patterns, including visual checks and decision-making, were similar when comparing drivers who made complete versus rolling stops. Non-compliant drivers did not differ from compliant drivers in approach speeds, but spent less time visually checking for trains. Post-drive interviews revealed some drivers wilfully disregarded the stop sign, whereas others did not notice the stop sign. Those who intentionally violated noted trains were infrequent and suggested sight distance was good enough (even though all crossings had been formally assessed as having inadequate sight distance). Overall the results suggest most drivers exhibit safe behaviour at passive RLXs, but a notable minority disregard or fail to notice signs. Potential avenues for redesigning passive RLXs to improve safety are discussed.","tags":null,"title":"To stop or not to stop: Contrasting compliant and non-compliant driver behaviour at rural rail level crossings","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ashleigh Filtness"],"categories":["project"],"content":"OMost people have some awareness of how sleepy they are.

This project investigated how subjective feelings about the eyes relate to objective observation of driving performance. 10 different eye symptoms were trialled with sleepy participants driving a simulator and on a real road. The two symptoms with strongest links to sleepiness were having ‘heavy eyelids’ and ‘difficulty keeping eyes open’, after this ‘eye strain’ and ‘difficulty focusing’ were next most associated with sleepiness.

These results suggest that food choice may contribute to weight-related chronic health problems commonly seen among night shift workers.","tags":null,"title":"Enhanced preference for high-fat foods following a simulated night shift","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Teodora Stefanova","Jean-Marie Burkhardt","Ashleigh Filtness","Christian Wullems","Andry Rakotonirainy","Patricia Delhomme"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1420070400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1420070400,"objectID":"b2e582eefd5077ab608c6312b5f7cd78","permalink":"/publication/stefanova-2015-systems/","publishdate":"2020-06-23T21:21:42.341035Z","relpermalink":"/publication/stefanova-2015-systems/","section":"publication","summary":"Crashes at level crossings are a major issue worldwide. In Australia, as well as in other countries, the number of crashes with vehicles has declined in the past years, while the number of crashes involving pedestrians seems to have remained unchanged. A systematic review of research related to pedestrian behaviour highlighted a number of important scientific gaps in current knowledge. The complexity of such intersections imposes particular constraints to the understanding of pedestrians’ crossing behaviour. A new systems-based framework, called Pedestrian Unsafe Level Crossing framework (PULC) was developed. The PULC organises contributing factors to crossing behaviour on different system levels as per the hierarchical classification of Jens Rasmussen’s Framework for Risk Management. In addition, the framework adapts James Reason’s classification to distinguish between different types of unsafe behaviour. The framework was developed as a tool for collection of generalizable data that could be used to predict current or future system failures or to identify aspects of the system that require further safety improvement. To give it an initial support, the PULC was applied to the analysis of qualitative data from focus groups discussions. A total number of 12 pedestrians who regularly crossed the same level crossing were asked about their daily experience and their observations of others’ behaviour which allowed the extraction and classification of factors associated with errors and violations. Two case studies using Rasmussen’s AcciMap technique are presented as an example of potential application of the framework. A discussion on the identified multiple risk contributing factors and their interactions is provided, in light of the benefits of applying a systems approach to the understanding of the origins of individual’s behaviour. Potential actions towards safety improvement are discussed.","tags":null,"title":"Systems-based approach to investigate unsafe pedestrian behaviour at level crossings","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ashleigh Filtness"],"categories":["media"],"content":"","date":1407160773,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1407160773,"objectID":"2944ac7322b994cfabce4e10125feb2d","permalink":"/publication/dailymail/","publishdate":"2014-08-04T14:59:33+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/dailymail/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["media"],"title":"Why new mothers shouldn't rush back to work: Many are still 'exhausted' four months after giving birth","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ashleigh Filtness"],"categories":["media"],"content":"","date":1407073322,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1407073322,"objectID":"a77655f0918017619a491dd43a2c730d","permalink":"/publication/telegraph/","publishdate":"2014-08-03T14:42:02+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/telegraph/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["media"],"title":"New mothers can suffer with baby brain four months after birth.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ashleigh J Filtness","Natassia Goode","Robert W Cook"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1388534400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1388534400,"objectID":"7126c897ec60e074502b0a8b7a7ad78a","permalink":"/publication/filtness-2014-causal/","publishdate":"2020-06-23T21:21:42.341864Z","relpermalink":"/publication/filtness-2014-causal/","section":"publication","summary":"#### Background:\nHot air ballooning incidents are relatively rare; however, when they do occur they are likely to result in a fatality or serious injury. Human error is commonly attributed as the cause of hot air ballooning incidents; however, error in itself is not an explanation for safety failures. This research aims to identify and establish the relative importance of factors contributing toward hot air ballooning incidents.\n#### Methods:\nTwenty-two Australian Ballooning Federation (ABF) incident reports were thematically coded using a bottom-up approach to identify causal factors. Subsequently, 69 balloonists (mean 19.51 yr experience) participated in a survey to identify additional causal factors and rate (out of 7) the perceived frequency and potential impact to ballooning operations of each of the previously identified causal factors. Perceived associated risk was calculated by multiplying mean perceived frequency and impact ratings.\n#### Results:\nIncident report coding identified 54 causal factors within 9 higher level areas: Attributes, Crew Resource Management, Equipment, Errors, Instructors, Organizational, Physical Environment, Regulatory Body, and Violations. Overall, ‘weather’, ‘inexperience,’ and ‘poor/inappropriate decisions’ were rated as having greatest perceived associated risk.\n#### Discussion:\nAlthough errors were nominated as a prominent cause of hot air ballooning incidents, physical environment and personal attributes are also particularly important for safe hot air ballooning operations. In identifying a range of causal factors, the areas of weakness surrounding ballooning operations have been defined; it is hoped that targeted safety and training strategies can now be put into place to remove these contributing factors and reduce the chance of pilot error.","tags":null,"title":"Causal factors of hot air ballooning incidents: identification, frequency, and potential impact","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Paul M Salmon","Michael G Lenné","Guy H Walker","Neville A Stanton","Ashleigh Filtness"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1388534400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1388534400,"objectID":"81b1f292758a00e74e17e8957a1d9d6d","permalink":"/publication/salmon-2014-exploring/","publishdate":"2020-06-23T21:21:42.335775Z","relpermalink":"/publication/salmon-2014-exploring/","section":"publication","summary":"Collisions between different road users make a substantial contribution to road trauma.

Although repeated measures analysis revealed there was no significant difference in the amount of nocturnal sleep and frequency of night-time wakings, there was a significant reduction in sleep disruption, due to fewer minutes of wake after sleep onset.

EAST was used to analyse behaviour at three intersections using data derived from an on-road study of driver, cyclist, motorcyclist and pedestrian behaviour. The analysis shows the differences in behaviour and cognition across the different road user groups and pinpoints instances where this may be creating conflicts between different road users. The role of intersection design in creating these differences in behaviour and resulting conflicts is discussed.

Within Australia attending police officers at a RTI report the causal factors; one option is fatigue/sleepiness. In some Australian jurisdictions police incident databases are subject to post hoc analysis using a proxy definition for fatigue/sleepiness. This secondary analysis identifies further RTIs caused by fatigue/sleepiness not initially identified by attending officers. The current study investigates the efficacy of such proxy definitions for attributing fatigue/sleepiness as a RTI causal factor. Over 1600 Australian drivers were surveyed regarding their experience and involvement in fatigue/sleep-related RTIs and near-misses during the past five years. Driving while fatigued/sleepy had been experienced by the majority of participants (66.0% of participants). Fatigue/sleep-related near misses were reported by 19.1% of participants, with 2.4% being involved in a fatigue/sleep-related RTI. Examination of the characteristics for the most recent event (either a near miss or crash) found that the largest proportion of incidents (28.0%) occurred when commuting to or from work, followed by social activities (25.1%), holiday travel (19.8%), or for work purposes (10.1%). The fatigue/sleep related RTI and near-miss experience of a representative sample of Australian drivers does not reflect the proxy definitions used for fatigue/sleepiness identification. In particular those RTIs that occur in urban areas and at slow speeds may not be identified. While important to have a strategy for identifying fatigue/sleepiness related RTIs proxy measures appear best suited to identifying specific subsets of such RTIs.","tags":null,"title":"Efficacy of proxy definitions for identification of fatigue/sleep-related crashes: An Australian evaluation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ashleigh J Filtness","Christina M Rudin-Brown","Christine Maree Mulvihill","Michael G Lenné"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1356998400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1356998400,"objectID":"c420e3e4c6b2e611f063f3081be8c76d","permalink":"/publication/filtness-2013-impairment/","publishdate":"2020-06-23T21:21:42.336974Z","relpermalink":"/publication/filtness-2013-impairment/","section":"publication","summary":"Crash statistics that include the blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of vehicle operators reveal that crash involved motorcyclists are over represented at low BACs (e.g., ≤0.05%).

It has been suggested that alcohol may redirect riders’ focus from higher-order cognitive skills such as cornering, judgement and hazard perception, to more physical skills such as maintaining balance. To test this hypothesis, the effects of low doses of alcohol on balance ability were investigated in a laboratory setting. The static balance of twenty experienced and twenty novice riders was measured while they performed either no secondary task, a visual (search) task, or a cognitive (arithmetic) task following the administration of alcohol (0%, 0.02%, and 0.05% BAC). Subjective ratings of intoxication and balance impairment increased in a dose-dependent manner in both novice and experienced motorcycle riders, while a BAC of 0.05%, but not 0.02%, was associated with impairments in static balance ability. This balance impairment was exacerbated when riders performed a cognitive, but not a visual, secondary task. Likewise, 0.05% BAC was associated with impairments in novice and experienced riders’ performance of a cognitive, but not a visual, secondary task, suggesting that interactive processes underlie balance and cognitive task performance. There were no observed differences between novice vs. experienced riders on static balance and secondary task performance, either alone or in combination.
