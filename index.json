Young drivers are at a disproportionately greater risk of sleep-related crashes than older drivers. Traditionally, interventions to reduce driver sleepiness have been passive strategies targeted at the general population such as the introduction of “Tiredness kills take a break” signs along motorways. This research addresses the gap by targeting those most at risk. A range of techniques (survey, focus group, expert panel interviews) will be used to understand situational factors which exacerbate young drivers risk and select intervention features with greatest potential to be effective. Ultimately, considerations and practical guidelines will be developed to support intervention development for enabling young drivers to reduce their own risk of sleep-related crashes. The project is funded by UK Department for Transport.\n","date":1594939714,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1594939714,"objectID":"073446293ac2e777233f18b469524685","permalink":"/project/sleepyoung/","publishdate":"2020-07-16T23:48:34+01:00","relpermalink":"/project/sleepyoung/","section":"project","summary":"First steps towards an intervention to improve the sleep health of newly licenced drivers","tags":["project"],"title":"Reducing the risk of sleep‐related crashes in young drivers","type":"project"},{"authors":["Ashleigh Filtness"],"categories":["media"],"content":"","date":1585058410,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1585058410,"objectID":"c83d7dc28c3e9ae85ead46c02d9e5995","permalink":"/publication/topmark/","publishdate":"2020-03-24T15:00:10+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/topmark/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["media"],"title":"Coffee and Crashes: Limit Your Caffeine","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ashleigh Filtness"],"categories":["Media"],"content":"","date":1583935223,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1583935223,"objectID":"19883268c8eb1dba7b843c12c30920d4","permalink":"/publication/commercialmotor/","publishdate":"2020-03-11T15:00:23+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/commercialmotor/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["Media"],"title":"Warning issued over high caffeine consumption for truck drivers","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ashleigh Filtness"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1579010416,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1579010416,"objectID":"b8f5916beee040aefc1f00017d12de0d","permalink":"/talk/futuretransport/","publishdate":"2020-07-16T23:03:40+01:00","relpermalink":"/talk/futuretransport/","section":"talk","summary":"Loughborough University academics answered a series of questions put to them by students on Instagram regarding the future of transport.","tags":["media"],"title":"Ask an Expert","type":"talk"},{"authors":["AJ Filtness","JS Hickman","JE Mabry","L Glenn","H Mao","M Camden","RJ Hanowski"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"904b917d8df79221aee61885605f884b","permalink":"/publication/filtness-2020-associations/","publishdate":"2020-06-23T21:21:42.353177Z","relpermalink":"/publication/filtness-2020-associations/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Associations between high caffeine consumption, driving safety indicators, sleep and health behaviours in truck drivers","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Fran Pilkington-Cheney","Ashleigh Filtness","Wendy Jones","Sally Maynard","Alistair Gibb","Roger Haslam"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"7d226cfcdf7db8b73b481f5ab459f289","permalink":"/publication/pilkington-2020-biomathematical/","publishdate":"2020-06-23T21:21:42.354054Z","relpermalink":"/publication/pilkington-2020-biomathematical/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Biomathematical modelling for managing worker fatigue in civil engineering","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lucienne Shenfield","Vanessa Beanland","Ashleigh Filtness","Deborah Apthorp"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"05e9a6f53559aa4cb407da43846f5f0d","permalink":"/publication/shenfield-2020-impact/","publishdate":"2020-06-23T21:21:42.353605Z","relpermalink":"/publication/shenfield-2020-impact/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"The impact of sleep loss on sustained and transient attention: an EEG study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ashleigh Filtness"],"categories":["media"],"content":"","date":1575985902,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1575985902,"objectID":"5de1b89b8d5b605d1944e953f8def4e7","permalink":"/publication/roadsafe/","publishdate":"2019-12-10T14:51:42+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/roadsafe/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["media"],"title":"Loughborough’s lifesaving road safety research given royal recognition at The Savoy","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ashleigh Filtness"],"categories":["project"],"content":"One of the most effective ways to counteract sleepiness when driving is to have a caffeinated drink and a nap. It is common advice given to truck drivers if they feel sleepy to have a caffeinated drink. However, caffeine is addictive. When this advice is repeatedly given it is possible some drivers may become regular consumers of high amounts of caffeine. This project set out to compare truck drivers who report drinking 5 or more caffeinated drinks every day with truck drivers that drink 1 caffeinated drink per day. High caffeine drinkers felt sleepier, got less sleep and had poorer diets, drank more alcohol and were more likely to smoke. Importantly the high caffeine use did not reduce the number of crashes drivers had, so it appears that caffeine is not beneficial in high amounts.\nThis project was complete while on a research visit to the Virginia Tech Transport Institute (VTTI)\n","date":1573941417,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1573941417,"objectID":"7d5bc725049606c4bd76f6f556fb2f7f","permalink":"/project/caffeine/","publishdate":"2019-11-16T22:56:57+01:00","relpermalink":"/project/caffeine/","section":"project","summary":"How safe is it for truck drivers to drink a lot of caffeine?","tags":["project"],"title":"Caffeine and truck drivers","type":"project"},{"authors":["Ashleigh Filtness"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1567415052,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1567415052,"objectID":"a98df2eeece12588f147b639d534b650","permalink":"/talk/att/","publishdate":"2020-07-16T23:11:35+01:00","relpermalink":"/talk/att/","section":"talk","summary":"You’ve worked a 12-hour shift, been up all night with a new baby, and driven back to work to start it all again, grabbing an energy drink before you go on shift. That’s normal, that’s ok, everyone does it, life carries on…\nYou’ve worked a 12-hour shift, slept fine for 8 hours, driven to work, stopped off for a pint before going back on shift. That’s not ok, that’s the way to endanger others and lose your job, with life-changing consequences…\nResearch suggests that 24 hours without sleep is the equivalent of being 25% over the UK drink-driving limit* and yet we don’t recognize how dangerous it is. Why don’t we treat tired driving like drunk driving? A review of international evidence indicates that driver fatigue may be a contributory factor in up to a fifth of road accidents, and up to one quarter of fatal and serious accidents. When you look at the number of deaths of people traveling to and from shift work, the figures should upset us. While data for some sectors is hard to come by, we know that in the decade up to 2018, 30 UK police officers were killed on the roads travelling to or from work, many in the early hours of the morning.\nAnd yet we still find it difficult to admit to being tired. In this podcast, Adam Christopher goes underground with the Bank Capacity Upgrade Project night shift to find out how shift patterns impact workers. He hears about the devastating effect on John Owens – arrested for dangerous driving after a shift. He also talks to specialist academics and practitioners Dr Ashleigh Filtness, Lecturer in Transport Safety at Loughborough Design School; Judith Devlin, HSE Advisor at Morgan Sindall Infrastructure; and Yvonne Taylor, Police Inspector and PhD research student about technological advances in fatigue management, and their retrospective approaches, observations and suggestions.\n*24 hours without sleep equivalent 100mg/100ml of blood where the UK drink-driving limit is 80mg/100ml of blood.

Sleep related crashes on low and high speed roads have similar characteristics: younger drivers (16-24y) are over represented, males are over represented, more likely to hit a stationary object, greater likelihood of severe outcome. Sleep related crashes are under reported, many people who have had a sleep related crash report that the police were not informed. Some jurisdictions who recognise the under reporting of sleep related crashes apply a proxy definition making an assumption that all crashes that fit set criteria are treated as sleep related.

They are reliant on their own perception to make the decision whether it is safe to cross or not. To investigate human capabilities to do this, we asked participants to observe approaching trains. Drivers can accurately detect that a train is moving when the train gets within 1.6km of them. Most people underestimate how quickly the train is travelling, (despite being confident in their speed estimate) and report that it would be safe to cross under situations where lights would have been activated at an active level crossing.\nIn a separate on-road investigation of driver behaviour at passive stop sign level crossings, we observed that 40% of drivers did not completely stop. Those drivers who did not stop spent less time visually checking for trains.\nAlthough, most drivers try to be safe at level crossings, the design of passive crossings can make it difficult for them to do so.\n","date":1486306664,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1486306664,"objectID":"cf3530c31ea839c37b5bf1762f555700","permalink":"/project/rlx/","publishdate":"2017-02-05T15:57:44+01:00","relpermalink":"/project/rlx/","section":"project","summary":"How

If someone falls asleep when they are driving it is rare that they will not have tried to do something to prevent sleepiness beforehand e.g. opening a window, talking to a passenger. Taking an action to try and counteract their sleepiness demonstrates that they are aware of their tiredness. However, some people report that they are not able to tell when they are sleepy. This project investigated how subjective feelings about the eyes relate to objective observation of driving performance. 10 different eye symptoms were trialled with sleepy participants driving a simulator and on a real road. The two symptoms with strongest links to sleepiness were having ‘heavy eyelids’ and ‘difficulty keeping eyes open’, after this ‘eye strain’ and ‘difficulty focusing’ were next most associated with sleepiness. Results suggest that drivers who are struggling to identify sleepiness could be helped with the advice ‘stop driving if you feel sleepy and/or have heavy eyelids or difficulty keeping your eyes open’.\nThis project was completed while on a research visit to the Swedish National Road and Transport Research Institute (VTI)\n","date":1468706217,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1468706217,"objectID":"17890b266e79938ed36b5c3222319386","permalink":"/project/eyes/","publishdate":"2016-07-16T22:56:57+01:00","relpermalink":"/project/eyes/","section":"project","summary":"Sleep Related eye symptoms","tags":["project"],"title":"Sleepy eyes","type":"project"},{"authors":["Ashleigh Filtness"],"categories":["project"],"content":"It is well known that lack of sleep increases sleepiness during the daytime.

To me sleepiness is biological, it is influence by how long it has been since you last slept, and your body clock. The feeling of sleepiness can only be mitigated by sleeping or by changing your biology with a chemical compound such as caffeine that acts on the brain. On the other hand, fatigue can have many causes. It is usually associated with having to sustain an activity for a long period of time, overload or underload. If you have been performing a monotonous task for a very long time and it is becoming boring and difficult to concentrate on, doing a different task often makes the fatigue go away. But if you were sleepy it would not matter if you changed the task because you would actually be carrying the sleepiness along with you.
