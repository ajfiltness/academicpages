&lt;p>Throughout my academic career I have always worked in dedicated transport/road safety centres, firstly at Monash University Accident Research Centre (MUARC), Monash University, then at the Centre for Accident Research and Road Safety - Queensland (CARRS-Q), QUT and most recently at the Transport Safety Research Centre (TSRC), Loughborough University. I have experience researching a range of transport safety topics including topics related to: driver sleepiness, driver fatigue, alcohol impairment, drug driving, situation awareness, driving in road works, co-location of road signs, road user differences (pedestrian, motorcycle, driver, cyclist), automated vehicles, vulnerable road users, evidence based policy making&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Example Transport safety related projects include:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Safety Cube&lt;/li>
&lt;li>ICAROS&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul></description></item></channel></rss>
