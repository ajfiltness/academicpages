&lt;p>I have always enjoyed sleeping, and have a high sleep ability, I first became interested in sleep from an academic point of view while studying for my Undergraduate Degree in Human Biology at Loughborough University. During the course I took a sleep module which opened my eyes (!) to the huge topic that is sleep research. I went on to complete my Ph.D investigating Obstructive Sleep Apnoea and Daytime driver sleepiness and have been fascinated with how sleepiness and safety interact ever since.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Fatigue</title><link>/project/fatigue/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Nov 2010 22:22:33 +0100</pubDate><guid>/project/fatigue/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="hahahugoshortcode-s0-hbhb">
&lt;i class="fas fa-tired pr-1 fa-fw">&lt;/i>&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>As a sleepiness and fatigue researcher I am innately aware of the difference between these two interacting concepts, while being conscious that for the majority of the population the terms are interchangeable. To me sleepiness is biological, it is influenced by how long it has been since you last slept, and your body clock. The feeling of sleepiness can only be mitigated by sleeping or by changing your biology with a chemical compound such as caffeine which acts on the brain. On the other hand, fatigue can have many causes. It is usually associated with having to sustain an activity for a long period of time, overload or underload. If you have been performing a monotonous task for a very long time and it is becoming boring and difficult to concentrate on, doing a different task often makes the fatigue go away. But if you were sleepy it would not matter if you changed the task because you would actually be carrying the sleepiness along with you. In my research I often consider both fatigue and sleepiness, seeking to understand the contributing factors to both and how to best mitigate the impact on safety&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Transport Safety</title><link>/project/transportsafety/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Oct 2010 22:54:14 +0100</pubDate><guid>/project/transportsafety/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="hahahugoshortcode-s0-hbhb">
&lt;i class="fas fa-car-crash pr-1 fa-fw">&lt;/i>&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Throughout my academic career I have always worked in dedicated transport/road safety centres, firstly at Monash University Accident Research Centre (MUARC), then at the Centre for Accident Research and Road Safety - Queensland (CARRS-Q), QUT and most recently at the Transport Safety Research Centre (TSRC), Loughborough University. I have experience researching a range of transport safety topics including topics related to: driver sleepiness, driver fatigue, alcohol impairment, drug driving, situation awareness, driving through road works, co-location of road signs, road user differences (pedestrian, motorcycle, driver, cyclist), automated vehicles, vulnerable road users, evidence based policy making&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Occupational Safety</title><link>/project/occsafety/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jul 2010 23:30:19 +0100</pubDate><guid>/project/occsafety/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="hahahugoshortcode-s0-hbhb">
&lt;i class="fas fa-hard-hat pr-1 fa-fw">&lt;/i>&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Most often my research in occupational safety focuses on professional drivers, including truck drivers, bus drivers, train and tram drivers. However, the key themes of sleepiness, fatigue, and human factors in safety are translatable to other industries e.g. construction and nuclear.&lt;/p>

&lt;i class="fas fa-train pr-1 fa-fw">&lt;/i>&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>My research experience within rail safety has covered a range of perspectives, including drivers, tracker workers and level crossing safety. In each experience I have investigated safety from a systems perspective, taking an all encompassing view point to comprehensively investigate all factors which can negatively impact safety.&lt;/p>

The work analysed formal incident reports and engaged with balloonists, to seek opinions of those actively involved in the sport. This systematic analysis resulted in recommendations for improvement in safety.&lt;/p>

When starting every new project, the first step is to identify the most appropriate method to investigate the research question of interest. Within any research project I commonly employ a mixed methods approach using both qualitative and quantitative techniques. In my quantitative research I particularly favour driving simulator’s and on-road investigations.&lt;/p>
