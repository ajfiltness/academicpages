Young drivers are at a disproportionately greater risk of sleep-related crashes than older drivers. Traditionally, interventions to reduce driver sleepiness have been passive strategies targeted at the general population such as the introduction of &lt;em>“Tiredness kills take a break”&lt;/em> signs along motorways. This research addresses the gap by targeting those most at risk. A range of techniques (survey, focus group, expert panel interviews) will be used to understand situational factors which exacerbate young drivers risk and select intervention features with greatest potential to be effective. Ultimately, considerations and practical guidelines will be developed to support intervention development for enabling young drivers to reduce their own risk of sleep-related crashes. The project is funded by UK Department for Transport.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>ICAROS</title><link>/project/icaros/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Jul 2019 15:49:28 +0100</pubDate><guid>/project/icaros/</guid><description>&lt;p>
&lt;a href="https://icaros.lboro.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ICAROS (International Research Centre to Investigate the Effects of Vehicle Automation on Vulnerable Road Users)&lt;/a> – part-funded by Research England – brings together researchers from Loughborough’s University’s Transport Safety Research Center(TSRC), Queensland University of Technology and Tongji University. The International research centre – led by TSRC– investigates the safety of vulnerable road users (VRU) as driverless cars – or connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) – become more prevalent.

The project was commissioned by Transport for London and conducted in collaboration with Dr Anna Anund and colleagues from the Swedish National Road and Transport Research Institute (VTI).&lt;/p>

The work was funded by the NRMA-ACT Road Safety Trust.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, the research found that drivers are best at detecting changes that involve other road users and targets with high safety relevance. The impact of safety relevance is greatest in demanding situations, e.g. when the visual environment is cluttered or at high travel speeds. Accuracy for change detection was maintained after sleep loss. There is limited evidence that sleep loss impairs efficiency of change detection in visually cluttered urban scenes, but not in rural scenes.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Train driver fatigue and sleepiness</title><link>/project/traindriver/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 Mar 2017 15:57:44 +0100</pubDate><guid>/project/traindriver/</guid><description>&lt;p>A signal passed at danger (SPAD) is considered one of the biggest safety breaches in rail. A series of focus groups with train drivers were conducted to discuss factors which can contribute to SPADS. This project used the existing focus groups to complete a targeted analysis of all mentions of fatigue or sleepiness. Drivers at all focus groups experienced fatigue/sleepiness despite each organisation having countermeasures in place aiming to reduce fatigue/sleepiness. Organisational culture was a barrier to effective fatigue/sleepiness management.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>OSA &amp; Driving</title><link>/project/osadriving/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Jul 2011 16:08:13 +0100</pubDate><guid>/project/osadriving/</guid><description>&lt;p>Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) and daytime driver sleepiness was the topic of my Ph.D (2011). In a series of driving simulator investigations this work demonstrated that OSA patients who have been using CPAP treatment for at least 1 year show no different in performance at driving in a simulator than healthy controls. However, OSA patients were more vulnerable to sleep loss, and without their CPAP treatment driving performance was significantly impaired compared to drivers of a similar age without OSA&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
