Young drivers are at a disproportionately greater risk of sleep-related crashes than older drivers. Traditionally, interventions to reduce driver sleepiness have been passive strategies targeted at the general population such as the introduction of &lt;em>“Tiredness kills take a break”&lt;/em> signs along motorways. This research addresses the gap by targeting those most at risk. A range of techniques (survey, focus group, expert panel interviews) will be used to understand situational factors which exacerbate young drivers risk and select intervention features with greatest potential to be effective. Ultimately, considerations and practical guidelines will be developed to support intervention development for enabling young drivers to reduce their own risk of sleep-related crashes. The project is funded by UK Department for Transport.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>ICAROS</title><link>/project/icaros/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Jul 2019 15:49:28 +0100</pubDate><guid>/project/icaros/</guid><description>&lt;p>

It is common advice given to truck drivers if they feel sleepy to have a caffeinated drink. However, caffeine is addictive. When this advice is repeatedly given it is possible some drivers may become regular consumers of high amounts of caffeine. This project set out to compare truck drivers who report drinking 5 or more caffeinated drinks every day with truck drivers that drink 1 caffeinated drink per day. High caffeine drinkers felt sleepier, got less sleep and had poorer diets, drank more alcohol and were more likely to smoke. Importantly the high caffeine use did not reduce the number of crashes drivers had, so it appears that caffeine is not beneficial in high amounts.&lt;/p>

This study investigated how fatigue/sleepiness is experienced and handled within the industry using the Tideway project as a case study. The project was funded by Tideway. Using qualitative research techniques we spoke to frontline workers, supervisors/managers, middle managers and those involved in shift scheduling. All groups recognised that tunnelling workers experience fatigue/sleepiness, the frontline workers were less likely to see this as impacting safety than the other groups. There are opportunities for the industry to improve fatigue/sleepiness management but this will require a shift of workplace culture.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Bus Driver Fatigue</title><link>/project/busdrivers/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Jul 2018 15:57:44 +0100</pubDate><guid>/project/busdrivers/</guid><description>&lt;p>This mixed methods research programme used focus groups, interviews, survey and on-road investigation to understand sleepiness and fatigue in London city bus drivers, and suggest potential solutions to mitigate the impact on safety.

Our findings have show that:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Sleep crashes are more common on high speed than low speed roads.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When sleep crashes do happen on low speed roads they have more severe outcomes than not sleep related crashes on the same roads.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sleep related crashes on low and high speed roads have similar characteristics: younger drivers (16-24y) are over represented, males are over represented, more likely to hit a stationary object, greater likelihood of severe outcome.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sleep related crashes are under reported, many people who have had a sleep related crash report that the police were not informed.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Some jurisdictions who recognise the under reporting of sleep related crashes apply a proxy definition making an assumption that all crashes that fit set criteria are treated as sleep related.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Applying a proxy definition can influence the overall observed characteristics of sleep crashes.&lt;/li>

The work was funded by the NRMA-ACT Road Safety Trust.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, the research found that drivers are best at detecting changes that involve other road users and targets with high safety relevance. The impact of safety relevance is greatest in demanding situations, e.g. when the visual environment is cluttered or at high travel speeds. Accuracy for change detection was maintained after sleep loss. There is limited evidence that sleep loss impairs efficiency of change detection in visually cluttered urban scenes, but not in rural scenes.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Train driver fatigue and sleepiness</title><link>/project/traindriver/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 Mar 2017 15:57:44 +0100</pubDate><guid>/project/traindriver/</guid><description>&lt;p>A signal passed at danger (SPAD) is considered one of the biggest safety breaches in rail. A series of focus groups with train drivers were conducted to discuss factors which can contribute to SPADS. This project used the existing focus groups to complete a targeted analysis of all mentions of fatigue or sleepiness. Drivers at all focus groups experienced fatigue/sleepiness despite each organisation having countermeasures in place aiming to reduce fatigue/sleepiness. Organisational culture was a barrier to effective fatigue/sleepiness management.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Level crossing safety</title><link>/project/rlx/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 Feb 2017 15:57:44 +0100</pubDate><guid>/project/rlx/</guid><description>&lt;p>I have been involved in two different projects investigating road safety at level crossings.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Passive rail crossings have no active warning systems to assist drivers. They are reliant on their own perception to make the decision whether it is safe to cross or not. To investigate human capabilities to do this, we asked participants to observe approaching trains. Drivers can accurately detect that a train is moving when the train gets within 1.6km of them. Most people underestimate how quickly the train is travelling, (despite being confident in their speed estimate) and report that it would be safe to cross under situations where lights would have been activated at an active level crossing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In a separate on-road investigation of driver behaviour at passive stop sign level crossings, we observed that 40% of drivers did not completely stop. Those drivers who did not stop spent less time visually checking for trains.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Although, most drivers try to be safe at level crossings, the design of passive crossings can make it difficult for them to do so.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Sleepy eyes</title><link>/project/eyes/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Jul 2016 22:56:57 +0100</pubDate><guid>/project/eyes/</guid><description>&lt;p>OMost people have some awareness of how sleepy they are. If someone falls asleep when they are driving it is rare that they will not have tried to do something to prevent sleepiness beforehand e.g. opening a window, talking to a passenger. Taking an action to try and counteract their sleepiness demonstrates that they are aware of their tiredness. However, some people report that they are not able to tell when they are sleepy. This project investigated how subjective feelings about the eyes relate to objective observation of driving performance. 10 different eye symptoms were trialled with sleepy participants driving a simulator and on a real road. The two symptoms with strongest links to sleepiness were having ‘heavy eyelids’ and ‘difficulty keeping eyes open’, after this ‘eye strain’ and ‘difficulty focusing’ were next most associated with sleepiness. Results suggest that drivers who are struggling to identify sleepiness could be helped with the advice ‘stop driving if you feel sleepy and/or have heavy eyelids or difficulty keeping your eyes open’.&lt;/p>

New mothers are highly likely to experience daytime sleepiness because of disruption to night time sleep. This study followed new mothers for 18 weeks after their baby was born. On weeks 6, 12 and 18 after giving birth mothers were asked to record their sleep and rate how sleepy they felt. The amount of night time sleep remained the same at each time point, as did the number of times the mothers were woken during the night, but the number of minutes they spent awake after each time of being woken reduced over time. Subjective sleepiness decreased at each time point. At week 18 half of the mothers were still experiencing excessive daytime sleepiness. Policy makers developing regulations for parental leave entitlements should be aware of this high prevalence of excessive daytime sleepiness and leave is long enough for daytime sleepiness to diminish to a manageable level prior to restarting work.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Young driver sleepiness</title><link>/project/oldyoung/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Feb 2016 15:57:44 +0100</pubDate><guid>/project/oldyoung/</guid><description>&lt;p>This study aimed to investigate why younger men are overrepresented in sleep-related crashes compared to older men, is it because younger men are more vulnerable to the effects of sleep loss? Using the safe environment of a driving simulator driving performance of older (average age =67 years) men was compared to that of younger (average age =23 years) men, after their night time sleep had been restricted to 5 hours. After the sleep restriction the younger drivers had worse driving performance and more signs of sleepiness in EEG recordings than the older drivers. When both groups were fully rested driving performance did not differ between the two age groups. Results show that younger drivers are more vulnerable to the effects of sleep loss than older drivers.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>OSA &amp; Driving</title><link>/project/osadriving/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Jul 2011 16:08:13 +0100</pubDate><guid>/project/osadriving/</guid><description>&lt;p>Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) and daytime driver sleepiness was the topic of my Ph.D (2011). In a series of driving simulator investigations this work demonstrated that OSA patients who have been using CPAP treatment for at least 1 year show no different in performance at driving in a simulator than healthy controls. However, OSA patients were more vulnerable to sleep loss, and without their CPAP treatment driving performance was significantly impaired compared to drivers of a similar age without OSA&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Sleepiness</title><link>/project/sleepiness/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Dec 2010 22:37:04 +0100</pubDate><guid>/project/sleepiness/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="hahahugoshortcode-s0-hbhb">

&lt;p>I have always enjoyed sleeping, and have a high sleep ability, I first became interested in sleep from an academic point of view while studying for my Undergraduate Degree in Human Biology at Loughborough University. During the course I took a sleep module which opened my eyes (!) to the huge topic that is sleep research.

&lt;p>As a sleepiness and fatigue researcher I am innately aware if the difference between these two interacting concepts, while being conscious that for the majority of the population the terms are interchangeable. To me sleepiness is biological, it is influence by how long it has been since you last slept, and your body clock. The feeling of sleepiness can only be mitigated by sleeping or by changing your biology with a chemical compound such as caffeine that acts on the brain. On the other hand, fatigue can have many causes. It is usually associated with having to sustain an activity for a long period of time, overload or underload. If you have been performing a monotonous task for a very long time and it is becoming boring and difficult to concentrate on, doing a different task often makes the fatigue go away. But if you were sleepy it would not matter if you changed the task because you would actually be carrying the sleepiness along with you. In my research I often consider both fatigue and sleepiness, seeking to understand the contributing factors to both and how to best mitigate the impact on safety&lt;/p>
