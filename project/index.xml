Young drivers are at a disproportionately greater risk of sleep-related crashes than older drivers. Traditionally, interventions to reduce driver sleepiness have been passive strategies targeted at the general population such as the introduction of &lt;em>“Tiredness kills take a break”&lt;/em> signs along motorways. This research addresses the gap by targeting those most at risk. A range of techniques (survey, focus group, expert panel interviews) will be used to understand situational factors which exacerbate young drivers risk and select intervention features with greatest potential to be effective. Ultimately, considerations and practical guidelines will be developed to support intervention development for enabling young drivers to reduce their own risk of sleep-related crashes. The project is funded by UK Department for Transport.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>ICAROS</title><link>/project/icaros/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Jul 2019 15:49:28 +0100</pubDate><guid>/project/icaros/</guid><description>&lt;p>
&lt;a href="https://icaros.lboro.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ICAROS (International Research Centre to Investigate the Effects of Vehicle Automation on Vulnerable Road Users)&lt;/a> – part-funded by Research England – brings together researchers from Loughborough’s University’s Transport Safety Research Center(TSRC), Queensland University of Technology and Tongji University. The International research centre – led by TSRC– investigates the safety of vulnerable road users (VRU) as driverless cars – or connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) – become more prevalent.

In a series of driving simulator investigations this work demonstrated that OSA patients who have been using CPAP treatment for at least 1 year show no different in performance at driving in a simulator than healthy controls. However, OSA patients were more vulnerable to sleep loss, and without their CPAP treatment driving performance was significantly impaired compared to drivers of a similar age without OSA&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Sleepiness</title><link>/project/sleepiness/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Dec 2010 22:37:04 +0100</pubDate><guid>/project/sleepiness/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="hahahugoshortcode-s0-hbhb">
&lt;i class="fas fa-bed pr-1 fa-fw">&lt;/i>&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>I have always enjoyed sleeping, and have a high sleep ability, I first became interested in sleep from an academic point of view while studying for my Undergraduate Degree in Human Biology at Loughborough University. During the course I took a sleep module which opened my eyes (!) to the huge topic that is sleep research. I went on to complete my Ph.D investigating Obstructive Sleep Apnoea and Daytime driver sleepiness and have been facilitated with how sleepiness and safety interact ever since.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Example Sleep research projects&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>OSA and driving&lt;/li>
&lt;li>iDreams&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sleep crashes&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sleep in new mothers&lt;/li>

&lt;i class="fas fa-tired pr-1 fa-fw">&lt;/i>&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>As a sleepiness and fatigue researcher I am innately aware if the difference between these two interacting concepts, while being conscious that for the majority of the population the terms are interchangeable. To me sleepiness is biological, it is influence by how long it has been since you last slept, and your body clock. The feeling of sleepiness can only be mitigated by sleeping or by changing your biology with a chemical compound such as caffeine that acts on the brain. On the other hand, fatigue can have many causes. It is usually associated with having to sustain an activity for a long period of time, overload or underload. If you have been performing a monotonous task for a very long time and it is becoming boring and difficult to concentrate on, doing a different task often makes the fatigue go away. But if you were sleepy it would not matter if you changed the task because you would actually be carrying the sleepiness along with you. In my research I often consider both fatigue and sleepiness, seeking to understand the contributing factors to both and how to best mitigate the impact on safety&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Example fatigue related projects include&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>OSA Driving&lt;/li>
&lt;li>iDreams&lt;/li>

&lt;i class="fas fa-car-crash pr-1 fa-fw">&lt;/i>&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Throughout my academic career I have always worked in dedicated transport/road safety centres, firstly at Monash University Accident Research Centre (MUARC), Monash University, then at the Centre for Accident Research and Road Safety - Queensland (CARRS-Q), QUT and most recently at the Transport Safety Research Centre (TSRC), Loughborough University. I have experience researching a range of transport safety topics including topics related to: driver sleepiness, driver fatigue, alcohol impairment, drug driving, situation awareness, driving in road works, co-location of road signs, road user differences (pedestrian, motorcycle, driver, cyclist), automated vehicles, vulnerable road users, evidence based policy making&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Example Transport safety related projects include:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Safety Cube&lt;/li>

&lt;i class="fas fa-hard-hat pr-1 fa-fw">&lt;/i>&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Most often my research in occupational safety focuses on professional drivers, including truck drivers, bus drivers, train and tram drivers. However, the key themes of sleepiness, fatigue, and human factors in safety are translatable to other industries e.g. construction and nuclear.&lt;/p>

&lt;li>bus driver fatigue&lt;/li>

&lt;i class="fas fa-train pr-1 fa-fw">&lt;/i>&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>My research experience within rail safety has covered a range of perspectives, including drivers, tracker workers and level crossing safety. In each experience I have investigated safety from a systems perspective, taking an all encompassing view point to comprehensively investigate all factors which can negatively impact safety.&lt;/p>

The work analysed formal incident reports and engaged with balloonists, to seek opinions of those actively involved in the sport. This systematic analysis resulted in recommendations for improvement in safety.&lt;/p>
